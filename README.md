A very generic how to:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a local clone of the repository on your pc
3. Choose what site you want to develop from, either from [issues](https://github.com/shosetsuorg/extensions/issues) or
   of your own choosing
4. Create a new branch on your local repository, following the following naming scheme `impl-thisisaname.domain`
5. Start to develop the extension
6. Make a PR of that branch into master
